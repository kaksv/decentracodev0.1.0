## Providing a platform where projects can be sponsored by the community.

What if most of the hackathon projects could be sponsored by the Community? 
The aim of Decentracode is to provide a platform where not only hackerthon bounty sponsors have access to submissions made by the participants, but the community can as well have access to these submisions and select their favourate projeccts to submit.

We have built an escrow smart contract where the interested sponsor of a given project not only donates to the milestones stipleted in the project with access to funding but a governance token of an equivalent amount is minted automatically to the sponsor address to give them priority in governance and easy tracking in case the project becomes robust enough to reward its investors.

From the frontend, the builders can simply submit a link where the project and streamlined documentation can be accessed and then interested members in the web3 community can access these different projects and can decide to sponsor them.

For more information, see the [platform at](https://decentracode.xyz) on the Decentracode Website.
