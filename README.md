## We are Providing a platform where projects can be sponsored by the community.

What if most of the hackathon projects could be sponsored by the Community? 
### The aim of Decentracode
is to provide a platform where not only hackerthon bounty sponsors have access to submissions made by the participants, 
but the community can as well have access to these submisions and select their favourate projeccts to submit.

- We have built an escrow smart contract where the interested sponsor of a given project not only donates to the milestones stipleted in the project with access to funding but a governance token of an equivalent amount is minted automatically to the sponsor address to give them priority in governance and easy tracking in case the project becomes robust enough to reward its investors.

From the platform, the builders can simply submit a link where the project and streamlined documentation can be accessed and then interested members in the web3 community can access these different projects and can decide to sponsor them.



- To submit your hack, visit the [decentracode platform, and submit your hacks](https://decentracodev0-1-0.vercel.app/).

For those interested in funding many of these awesome projects to keep African builders capacitated to remain building for a global impact, Share to the escrow smart contract based on the project that intrigues you the most.

Access these smart contracts from the smart contracts folder and provide your escrow tokens through our testnet networks such as sepolia eth, optimism and base.
